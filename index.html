                <h3>What is COVID-19(Corona-Virus)</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.<br>
                    Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and 
                    recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like 
                    cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.<br>
                    The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it 
                    causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based 
                    rub frequently and not touching your face. <br>   
                    The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person 
                    coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a 
                    flexed elbow).

                        You should get a COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to you.
                        Once you are fully vaccinated, you may be able to start doing some things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic.

                    <h1>Wear a mask</h1>
                    <p>
                        Everyone 2 years and older should wear masks in public.
                        Masks should be worn in addition to staying at least 6 feet apart, especially around people who donâ€™t live with you.
                        If someone in your household is infected, people in the household should take precautions including wearing masks to avoid spread to others.
                        Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before putting on your mask.
                        Wear your mask over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin.
                        Fit the mask snugly against the sides of your face, slipping the loops over your ears or tying the strings behind your head.
                        If you have to continually adjust your mask, it doesnâ€™t fit properly, and you might need to find a different mask type or brand.
                        Make sure you can breathe easily.

                        If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members.
                        Outside your home: Put 6 feet of distance between yourself and people who donâ€™t live in your household.
                        Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.
                        Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from other people.
                        Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.

                        Itâ€™s especially important to wash:

                        After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing
                        After handling your mask
                        After changing a diaper
                        After caring for someone sick
                        After touching animals or pets
                        If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
                        Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

                        Throw used tissues in the trash.
                        Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

                        Be alert for symptoms. Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19.
                        Especially important if you are running essential errands, going into the office or workplace, and in settings where it may be difficult to keep a physical distance of 6 feet.
                        Take your temperature if symptoms develop.
                        Donâ€™t take your temperature within 30 minutes of exercising or after taking medications that could lower your temperature, like acetaminophen.
                        Follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop.
